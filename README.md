# [Giulio Procopio][1]'s Atom Retro Syntax Theme
![Syntax Screenshot][2]
This is essentially vendored from [Melina Donati's][3] [90s-tshirt-syntax][4],
however some things didn't sound like they were right.  For example, reducing
font size of comments causes columns missaligning and preferred line length
basically blows up.
